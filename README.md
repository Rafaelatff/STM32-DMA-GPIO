# STM32-DMA-GPIO
This repository was create to follow the content of the course 'ARM Cortex M Microcontroller DMA Programming Demystified'.

## Intro

Basically, DMA work as master together with the processor, so the memory functions (such as access and storing info) can be performed by DMA, and not generating interrupts to the processor. Also, DMA saves power when compared to processor functions.
